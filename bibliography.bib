abstract = {Multi-core parallelism and accelerators are becoming common features of today's computer systems, as they allow for computational power without sacrificing energy efficiency. Due to heterogeneity, tuning for each type of compute unit and adequate load balancing is essential. This paper proposes static and dynamic solutions for load balancing in the context of an application for visualizing high-dimensional simulation data. The application relies on the sparse grid technique for data compression. Its performance critical part is the interpolation routine used for decompression. Results show that our load balancing scheme allows for an efficient acceleration of interpolation on heterogeneous systems containing multi-core CPUs and GPUs.},

@article{Murali2004,
abstract = {We address the design of complex monolithic systems, where processing cores generate and consume a varying and large amount of data, thus bringing the communication links to the edge of congestion. Typical applications are in the area of multi-media processing. We consider a mesh-based networks on chip (NoC) architecture, and we explore the assignment of cores to mesh cross-points so that the traffic on links satisfies bandwidth constraints. A single-path deterministic routing between the cores places high bandwidth demands on the links. The bandwidth requirements can be significantly reduced by splitting the traffic between the cores across multiple paths. In this paper, we present NMAP, a fast algorithm that maps the cores onto a mesh NoC architecture under bandwidth constraints, minimizing the average communication delay. The NMAP algorithm is presented for both single minimum-path routing and split-traffic routing. The algorithm is applied to a benchmark DSP design and the resulting NoC is built and simulated at cycle accurate level in SystemC using macros from the /spl times/pipes library. Also, experiments with six video processing applications show significant savings in bandwidth and communication cost for NMAP algorithm when compared to existing algorithms.},

abstract = {Network-on-chip (NoC) has been proposed as a solution for the global communication challenges of system-on-chip (SoC) design in the nanoscale technologies. NoC design with mesh based topologies requires mapping of cores to router ports, and routing of traffic traces such that the bandwidth and latency constraints are satisfied. The authors presented a novel automated design technique that solves the mesh based NoC design problem with an objective of minimizing the communication energy. In contrast to existing research that only take bandwidth constraints as inputs, the technique solves the NoC design problem in the presence of bandwidth as well as latency constraints. The technique was compared with a recent work called NMAP and an optimal MILP based formulation. It is proven that the complexity of the technique is lower than that of NMAP. For the latency constrained case, while NMAP fails on most test cases, the technique is able to generate high quality results. In comparison to the MILP formulation, the results produced by our technique are within 14 {\%} of the optimal.},

abstract = {The large processing requirements of seismic wave propagation simulations make High Performance Computing (HPC) architectures a natural choice for their execution. However, to keep both the current pace of performance improvements and the power consumption under a strict power budget, HPC systems must be more energy efficient than ever. As a response to this need, energy-efficient and low-power processors began to make their way into the market. In this paper we employ a novel low-power processor, the MPPA-256 manycore, to perform seismic wave propagation simulations. It has 256 cores connected by a NoC, no cache-coherence and only a limited amount of on-chip memory. We describe how its particular architectural characteristics influenced our solution for an energy-efficient implementation. As a counterpoint to the low-power MPPA-256 architecture, we employ Xeon Phi, a performance-centric manycore. Although both processors share some architectural similarities, the challenges to implement an efficient seismic wave propagation kernel on these platforms are very different. In this work we compare the performance and energy efficiency of our implementations for these processors to proven and optimized solutions for other hardware platforms such as general-purpose processors and a GPU. Our experimental results show that MPPA-256 has the best energy efficiency, consuming at least 77{\%} less energy than the other evaluated platforms, whereas the performance of our solution for the Xeon Phi is on par with a state-of-the-art solution for GPUs.},
